#   1. _diag/macro_parse_probe.cpp -- the ACT line parser over lines copied from reaper-kb.ini.
#   2. _diag/macro_gate_probe.cpp  -- which children the macro rule accepts and, more importantly,
#      which it MUST refuse: a "one page" scroll (jumps a whole page per call, ignores the value
#      handed in -- AGENTS.md 19.8), a script, a nested macro, a plain non-wheel "View:" action.
#      Accepting any of those would animate something that must run once.
#   3. _diag/macro_chain_probe.cpp -- the whole chain: ACT line -> children -> one notch split across
#      them, asserting every child is reached and each gets the full travel. This is the check that a
#      cross-axis macro (zoom both ways -- the common shape) works.
#
# All three include the REAL src/macro.h and src/routing.h, not copies.
