// SmoothWheelScroll for REAPER
//
// Port of the WPF SmoothWheelScrollBehavior module to a native REAPER extension.
//
// The plugin does ONE thing: turn a wheel notch into an elegant, animated
// parameter and hand that to the receiver. It never moves a view itself and never
// changes REAPER state -- see AGENTS.md for the binding rules of this project.
//
// Because bindings are fully user-customisable, we never guess from modifiers.
// Instead REAPER resolves the wheel to an action and reports it through
// hookcommand2; we then classify that action:
//
//   - view scroll / zoom -> consume it and re-invoke THE SAME ACTION over time
//     with the animated relative value
//   - anything else (parameters, tempo, transport, track height, custom, ...)
//     -> do nothing, let REAPER run it untouched, with the original value
//
// This is the "unified port": hookcommand2 covers every key section (main,
// MIDI editor, ...), so any view whose wheel operation is an action is covered.
//
// Driving: action replay only. The action receives a relative value (a wheel
// notch is kNotchUnits units) and does all the moving, so zoom centre, range
// limits and any user customisation stay exactly the action's business.
//   - main section  : KBD_OnMainActionEx
//   - other sections: the section's own onAction callback (see ReplayAction)
//
// List/tree controls have no action bound to their wheel, so they are handled
// separately through the OS control interface (WM_VSCROLL) -- still no REAPER
// state touched.
//
// The motion itself (the animation) lives behind model.h and is pure math,
// independent of REAPER; test/anim_sim.cpp exercises it standalone.

// Plain C headers first, unconditionally, on every platform: SWELL's headers
// (pulled in below on non-Windows) #define min/max as 2-arg macros, which
// breaks any later-included libc/libstdc++ header that uses those names as
// identifiers (std::numeric_limits<T>::max(), etc). Including these first
// means they are fully parsed before that macro exists.

// Tunables -- runtime values, adjustable from the config window (see below).
//
// The motion is a simple physical model: every wheel notch gives the view a
// velocity (an impulse), and friction bleeds it off. Position integrates that
// velocity, so a notch starts from rest, accelerates, coasts and settles -- the
// natural feel -- and repeated notches add their impulses before the previous one
// has decayed, so a sustained roll builds speed.
//
//   1. START    length of the FIRST notch's travel, in % of one wheel notch
//   2. ACCEL    extra travel added to each further notch's impulse, same unit
//   3. RELEASE  the base coast-out time (the brake) after a slow roll
//
// Friction is derived from RELEASE (velocity falls by e^-6 over that time).
//
// BRAKE BY RHYTHM: RELEASE is the brake when you roll unhurried. Rolling fast
// shortens the gap between notches, and a fast rhythm loosens the brake -- the
// motion decays more slowly, so it coasts further. The brake chosen by the last
// rhythm is kept through the coast-out, so a quick flick keeps sliding even after
// you stop. See kTempoRefMs / kBrakeRelaxMax.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE MODEL'S PARAMETERS
//
//  1. WINDOW (ms)  -- pure timing: a received amount is handed over across this many ms. Nothing here
//                     changes the DISTANCE, only how it is spread out. See anim3_core.h.
//  2. START (deltas)   -- how far a single, slow notch moves, 1..10. This is the fine,
//                     touchpad-like
//                     step at a slow deliberate turn. It is in wheel DELTAS, so it means the same
//                     thing for a notched mouse (120/message) and a free-spinner (small/message).
//  3. BUDGET (deltas)  -- how much turning it takes for a notch to reach its full size. The budget
//                     follows the current speed (it decays), so a steady hand speed gives a steady
//                     glide at whatever speed the user holds -- see model::SpeedBudget.
//
// The travel a notch goes is model::Travel(): `start` at a standstill, rising to the message's own
// size (120 for a notched mouse, its small share for a free-spinner) once the budget is full.

// can be transmitted far more finely than that.
//
// The exact encoding is REAPER's own, take it from the SDK rather than guessing:

// THE MOTION CHART -- a BALL RUNNING A TRACK, and a track shaped by the four sliders.
//
// The panel used to show a table of the last few deltas in and out. A table answers "which numbers
// moved"; it does not answer "what does this FEEL like", which is what the sliders are for. So the
// block became a motion chart, and then a ball on that chart -- a ball is read without thinking: it
// goes, it climbs, it arrives, and a second one follows.
//
// EACH SLIDER OWNS ONE VISUAL CHANNEL. That is the whole design, and it is why the chart is a
// SCHEMATIC rather than a run of the model: a model run's SHAPE depends on how the mechanisms happen
// to interact, so two sliders could look like they do the same thing (or nothing). Here each slider
// moves one obvious property of the picture, and no two share one:
//
//   * Glide length -> the WIDTH of the whole drawing (how long the motion takes);
//   * Slow step    -> the HEIGHT of the first segment's end (the knee), in that slider's colour;
//   * Ramp-up      -> the SLOPE of the climb from the knee to the native height, in its colour;
//   * Top speed    -> how far PAST the native height the climb continues, in its colour.
//
// The GREY STAIRCASE is the reference: what the wheel itself would do with the same input. It always
// tops out at the NATIVE height, and the ball HOPS up it (square ball). A notched mouse lands whole
// notches (a coarse staircase); a free-spinning wheel works in fine pieces (a fine one) -- the
// "coarse grid / fine grid" difference, visible as the size of the hops.
//
// The SMOOTH path (round ball) is the shaped one, and its peak is what Top speed scales: at 1.0 the
// curve tops out exactly AT the native line, at 2.0 at TWICE it. Because the native line is drawn
// where the staircase tops out, pulling Top speed up visibly sinks that reference -- "twice as far"
// is read directly off the picture, no numbers needed.
//
// WHEN BALLS ARE BORN: one per received wheel message (a roll therefore shows several in flight at
// once, capped at kAnimBalls, oldest discarded first), one when a fader is RELEASED after dragging
// (the user's "let go of the lever and one runs"), and one on a reset / a switch flip.
//
// COST: one small pass over the path (a few hundred points) when a slider moves or a wheel arrives,
// plus a ~40 fps repaint of ONE SMALL RECTANGLE while a ball is in flight. Both are trivial; and the
// repaint is bounded to this block, because repainting the whole panel per wheel was measured to be
// expensive (AGENTS.md 69).

//
// WHAT THE PLUGIN DOES INSTEAD: it drives the list itself from ONE glide. Measured on this machine
// (Win+wheel on a two-action macro): REAPER dispatches the macro as ONE command (its own id), and
// hands it the SAME relative value a plain wheel gets -- relmode=1, val=113 for one notch, identical
// to the bare wheel. So no extra wheel state is needed: the relative amount is already in hand, and
// the children are simply fed the same travel through the ordinary replay path.
//
// WHERE THE LIST COMES FROM: not the SDK -- its documentation says custom action ID strings are
// found in reaper-kb.ini, so that file is READ (the same kind of read the plugin already makes to
// reaper.ini for the dark flag; nothing in REAPER's install is ever written -- AGENTS.md 5). The
// command id gives the id STRING via ReverseNamedCommandLookup, which is the key into that file;
// src/macro.h does the parsing.
//
// ALL OR NOTHING: the macro is taken over only when EVERY child passes ClassifyCommand. One child the
// plugin does not recognise -- a "one page" scroll, a script, another macro, anything that is not a
// scroll/zoom it drives -- and the whole macro is left to REAPER. That rule is not caution for its
// own sake: a macro runs each action ONCE, while the plugin replays an action many times to spread
// the travel out. If a macro contained "select next item", animating it would select dozens of them.

//
//   WHICH WAY it leans (light text on dark, or the reverse) -> REAPER's own `win32_darkmode`
//     switch, via ReadAppDarkFlag. This is the one yes/no that a colour cannot answer.
//
// The split is deliberate. Deciding the DIRECTION from the background's brightness was the earlier
// approach and is wrong whenever the theme's arrange colour does not track REAPER's mode; asking
// the flag fixes that. But hard-coding the COLOURS (tried in between) was a regression in the other
// direction -- the dark panel came out as a flat self-made grey instead of the theme's own dark
// colours. Colours from the theme, direction from the flag.
//
// WHY TWO ROUTES TO THE FLAG: get_config_var was measured not to answer for this key on this
// machine (it returns a null pointer and leaves the size untouched), while reaper.ini does. Both
// are reads; the plugin writes nothing of REAPER's.
